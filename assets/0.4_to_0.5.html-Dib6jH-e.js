For the most part the Daemon can handle all of the internal changes that make this possible, you&#39;ll just need to remove the old Docker container for SFTP.</p><p>To do so, simply run the following commands, changing <code>2022</code> if you are using a different port.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token function">docker</span> rmi <span class="token parameter variable">-f</span> quay.io/pterodactyl/scrappy

Once it has finished running and the Daemon is up and running, stop it again using <code>CTRL+C</code>.</p><p>If for whatever reason you need your user to be named something other than <code>pterodactyl</code> you can change that in the <code>core.json</code> before booting the Daemon by setting the <code>docker.container.username</code> key. 99.9% of users will not need to change the username.</p><h2 id="file-migration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#file-migration"><span>File Migration</span></a></h2><p>Now for the longest part of the upgrade: data migration. You only need to migrate data once when updating from v0.4.X.</p><p>You&#39;ll need all of your servers to be stopped for this part of the migration. All of their containers will also need to be rebuilt, but this will be completed on the Panel with a console command since we also need to update their configurations with some new data. We will run that command after we migrate all of the data.</p><p>To perform this migration, simply run the command below in the Daemon directory and follow its prompts. Be aware it might take a few minutes to run, especially with large volumes of data.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">npm</span> run migrate

If you have all daemons running and wish to update them all at once, remove the <code>--node</code> flag.</p><p>Boot the Daemon one last time in the foreground, make sure it completes without errors, and then you can stop it and restart it using your service: <code>sudo systemctl start wings</code>.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Thanks!</p><p>You&#39;re all finished!
